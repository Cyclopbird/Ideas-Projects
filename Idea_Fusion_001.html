<h1>Nuclear Fusion: Principles and Applications</h1>
<p><strong>Idea ID:</strong> Idea_Fusion_002</p>
<p><strong>Author:</strong> Martin Wieser</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This idea covers the fundamental principles of nuclear fusion, its role in stellar energy production, and experimental technologies aimed at harnessing fusion energy on Earth.</p>

<h2>Core Content</h2>

<h3>What is Nuclear Fusion?</h3>
<p>Nuclear fusion is the process by which two light atomic nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus, releasing a tremendous amount of energy due to mass-energy equivalence (<code>E=mcÂ²</code>).</p>

<h3>Fusion in Stars</h3>
<p>Stars, including our Sun, generate energy primarily through fusion of hydrogen nuclei into helium under extreme temperature and pressure conditions.</p>

<h3>Fusion Reactors on Earth</h3>
<p>Technologies like the tokamak aim to replicate fusion by confining plasma at millions of degrees using magnetic fields to achieve the conditions needed for sustained fusion.</p>

<h3>Challenges and Progress</h3>
<p>Key challenges include achieving net positive energy output, maintaining plasma stability, and handling material stresses. Recent projects have made significant strides but commercial fusion remains a future goal.</p>

  <h3>Full Notes and References</h3>
  <p>Fusion reactions release energy because the binding energy per nucleon increases for nuclei around iron; light nuclei fusing release this excess energy.</p>
  <p>Tokamak designs employ toroidal magnetic confinement, but alternative designs like inertial confinement fusion also exist.</p>
  <p>Ongoing research aims to solve plasma instability, neutron flux damage, and fuel cycle optimization.</p>
