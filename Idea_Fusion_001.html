  <h2>Resonant Excitation to Support Nuclear Fusion</h2>

  <p>
    This hypothesis explores the possibility of facilitating nuclear fusion by targeting the natural resonant frequencies of electrons and atomic nuclei. If external energy – such as mechanical, acoustic, magnetic, electric, or thermal – is applied in resonance with these frequencies, it could amplify the particles' motion and help overcome the Coulomb barrier, enabling fusion at lower energy thresholds than in conventional systems.
  </p>

  <h3>Core Points</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Atoms and their components have natural frequencies of oscillation.</li>
    <li>Applying energy in sync with these frequencies may boost their amplitude (resonance).</li>
    <li>This could weaken or disrupt electron orbitals and allow nuclei to merge more easily.</li>
    <li>The method may complement or improve existing fusion approaches (e.g. magnetic confinement or inertial fusion).</li>
    <li>Dynamic energy input is key – constant resonance rather than static pressure or heat.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Notes (Simplified Explanation)</h3>
  <p>
    Just like a swing moves higher if you push it at the right rhythm, atoms may be pushed into fusion more easily if energy is added at just the right frequency. This could make fusion happen with less brute force.
