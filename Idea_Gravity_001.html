  <h2>Hypothesis on Gravitation from Electron Compression Forces</h2>

  <p>
    This hypothesis suggests that gravitation may arise not solely from mass, but primarily from the compression of electron clouds within atoms. When matter is compacted, the electron shells resist due to repulsive forces. This resistance creates an internal pressure that other nearby matter “compensates” by attracting, leading to a net attractive force on the macroscopic scale – what we observe as gravity.
  </p>

  <h3>Core Points</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Electrons resist compression, leading to a repulsive pressure within matter.</li>
    <li>Other matter is drawn in to balance this pressure, resulting in attraction.</li>
    <li>The cumulative effect could manifest as gravity, especially at scale.</li>
    <li>This mechanism may supplement or partially replace classical gravitational explanations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Notes (Simplified Explanation)</h3>
  <p>
    Think of atoms as little balloons. When compressed, they push back. If you have many such atoms pushing back, other atoms might get "pulled" toward them to help balance the pressure. This collective behavior could be what we call gravity.
