  <h1>Origin of Life</h1>
  <p><strong>Author:</strong> Martin Wieser</p>
  <p><strong>Location:</strong> Salzburg, Austria</p>
  <p><strong>Description:</strong> A scientific hypothesis on the origin of life based on chemical stability principles, noble gas configurations, cumulative probability, and evolutionary concepts.</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Life on Earth likely emerged through a complex combination of chemical processes favoring stable structures. Fundamental chemical principles, such as noble gas configurations, and statistical probabilities play key roles.</p>

  <h2>Chemical Principles and Stability</h2>
  <p>Atoms tend to achieve stable electron configurations, often matching those of noble gases. By forming bonds, atoms aim to fill their outer electron shells, resulting in energetically favorable and stable arrangements.</p>
  
  <h2>Cumulative Probability and Life</h2>
  <p>Under appropriate chemical and physical conditions, simple molecules can combine over long periods into more complex structures. These processes rely on cumulative probability: the more favorable coincidences occur, the higher the chance life emerges.</p>

  <h2>Evolutionary Process</h2>
  <p>Once stable structures arise, evolutionary mechanisms select and refine the most stable and functional configurations, progressively leading to complex living organisms.</p>

  <h2>Humans and the Search for Order</h2>
  <p>Humans inherently seek structure, balance, and order, mirroring natural stability principles observed from atoms to cells. This shared drive supports the hypothesis that order and stability are fundamental in both life’s origin and human cognition.</p>

  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Noble gas configurations explain atoms’ drive toward stable electron arrangements.</li>
    <li>Cumulative probability accounts for the gradual emergence of complex molecules.</li>
    <li>Evolution shapes these molecules into living organisms.</li>
    <li>Humans reflect this universal search for order and stability in their scientific and cognitive endeavors.</li>
  </ul>
