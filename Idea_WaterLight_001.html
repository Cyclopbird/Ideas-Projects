  <h2>Experimental Investigation of Water Structures Influenced by Sound, Glass Spacing, and Density Variations</h2>

  <p>
    This hypothesis proposes studying how sound waves, the spacing between glass surfaces, and changes in water density affect the physical structure of water. By precisely controlling these variables and observing water through transparent glass with adjustable gaps, it may be possible to detect structural changes induced by acoustic excitation and density variation.
  </p>

  <h3>Core Points</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Glass spacing and its transmission properties can influence water behavior.</li>
    <li>Different salt concentrations change water density and may affect its structure.</li>
    <li>Sound waves (music) may cause vibrational changes in water’s structure.</li>
    <li>Combining these factors in experiments could reveal previously underestimated effects.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Notes (Simplified Explanation)</h3>
  <p>
    Just like how music can make objects vibrate, sound waves might change how water molecules arrange themselves—especially when the water is between glass plates spaced in specific ways or has different salt levels.
