    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      This hypothesis suggests that nuclear fusion might be facilitated by inducing resonant oscillations in atomic electrons and nuclei, 
      using controlled energy pulses (electrical, acoustic, mechanical, electromagnetic, thermal).
      Instead of relying solely on extreme pressure and temperature, fusion could be initiated by driving the particles to “over-swing” via resonance.

    <h2>Details</h2>
    <p>
      The central idea is to excite atoms at their natural resonance frequencies, amplifying vibrations to the point where electron clouds shift, 
      facilitating closer nucleus proximity and overcoming Coulomb barriers more efficiently.
      Energy can be delivered in ultrashort bursts, tuned dynamically along a frequency curve (not static) to match shifting energy states.
    </p>
    <p>
      Excitation methods can include acoustic waves, mechanical vibrations, electromagnetic pulses, and thermal modulation.
      This dynamic resonance approach may reduce the otherwise colossal pressures and temperatures typically required for fusion.
